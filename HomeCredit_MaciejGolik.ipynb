    "# Predicting Client's default risk\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font size=\"4.5\">This analysis/forecast is going to be made using Random Forest algorithim. The motivations behind choosing such solution in this particular case are as follows:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- It produces good results without much hyper-paremeter tuning\n",
    "- It is simple and diverse, therefore a good choice when the analysis needs to be done quickly (as in this case)\n",
    "- It's been used in similar cases (Schonlau and Zou, 2020)\n",
    "- Random forests are more accurate when the dataset is large (as in this case)\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "To build the algorithm 14 features were used. Here's a quick overview with explanation as to why this variable was chosen:\n",
    "    \n",
    "| Feature Name            | Description                      | Why it was used |\n",
    "| :---                    |    :----:                        |          ---: |\n",
    "| OCCUPATION_TYPE         |What kind of occupation does the client have| Occupation type plays a very big role in current income but also income perspectives and perspectives of a Client if he/she is let go (if the Client had a good job earlier it is more probable that he/she gets a good job next time) |\n",
    "| DAYS_BIRTH             |Client's age in days at the time of application | Age of the Client is important, since older Clients tend to be more reliable in terms of their financial situation than younger Clients |\n",
    "| FLAG_OWN_CAR            |Flag if the client owns a car | Car ownership proves that the Client is able to finance a big buy and still be in a good financial condition, car has also a big share in people's total wealth and as such can add to Client's payment ability |\n",
    "| FLAG_OWN_REALTY         |Flag if client owns a house or flat | A flat is an anther big aspect of the Client's total wealth and potentially is a asset that can be liquidated (although not with ease). Also, flat or house ownership proves the Client is able to make cyclical payments |\n",
    "| CNT_CHILDREN            |Number of children the client has | The more children a Client has, the bigger financial responsibility for her/him, this can potentially be a very big risk factor |\n",
    "| AMT_INCOME_TOTAL        |Income of the client | One of the most important features, it is a primary variable to assess the Client by. The higher the income the bigger the probability the Client will make payments on time |\n",
    "| NAME_INCOME_TYPE        |Clients income type  | Type of income is extremely important because different income sources have different level of dependability and some are less risk-creating than others |\n",
    "| NAME_EDUCATION_TYPE     |Level of highest education the client achieved | The higher educated the Client the better his material situation will be - now or potentially (statistically speaking |\n",
    "| DAYS_EMPLOYED           |How many days before the application the person started current employment | If the person just started new job it can idicate he/she often changes occupation and his/hers income is not constant. And thus, if the Client has been working in the same job for the long period of time, it proves he/she is stable and trustworthy |\n",
    "| REG_REGION_NOT_LIVE_REGION| Flag if client's permanent address does not match contact address | If Client permanent adress and contact adress are different it can idicate he/she is still somehow dependant (for example a student on the sources from the permanent adress. |\n",
    "| ORGANIZATION_TYPE       |Type of organization where client works | Some types of organizations lay off their workers often. Workers from some types of organizations tend to be in better material conditions (corporate workers) |\n",
    "| DAYS_DELAYED_PAYMENT    |Number of days the Client is late with payment | The longer the delay higher the risk of repeating this situations and even defaulting. This is one of the most important variables. |\n",
    "| AMOUNT_UNDERPAID        |Amount by which the Client underpaid the installment | The higher this amout the bigger risk of repeating this situation and potentially defaulting. Also a very important variable |\n",
    "| EXT_SOURCE_2            |Normalized score from external data source| Since this variable was chosen for the dataset it must hold a high value. External analysis is also very important. |\n",
